 Admin Users Table
Title: View and Export Admin Users Table
Story Description: As an admin user, I want to view a table of registered users in the Admin Panel and export it in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats so that I can manage user accounts and share user data.
Acceptance Criteria:
Given I am logged into the Admin Panel, I see a "Users" table with columns: User ID, Full Name, Email Address, Phone Number, Company Name, Registration Date, Account Status (Active/Inactive).
I can invite a new user by adding Full Name and Email Address.
I can sort the table by Full Name, Email Address, or Registration Date.
I can paginate the table with options for 10, 25, or 50 entries per page.
I can search by Full Name or Email Address.
I can export the table data in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats via an "Export" dropdown or buttons.
Exported files are named appropriately (e.g., "Users_{Timestamp}.pdf/csv/xlsx").
Validations with Success/Error Messages:
Table Data:
Success: Table loads with correct user data.
Error: If no data, display: "No users available."
Search:
Success: Results filter based on input.
Error: If no results, display: "No results found."
Export:
Success: File downloads in selected format (PDF, CSV, Excel).
Error: "Failed to export [format]. Please try again."
Expected Outcome:
The admin views, sorts, searches, and exports user data in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats.
If no data is available or an export fails, clear error messages are displayed.
Definition of Done:
"Users" table with specified columns is implemented in the Admin Panel.
Sorting, pagination (10, 25, 50 entries), and search by Full Name/Email Address are functional.
Export functionality for PDF, CSV, and Excel is implemented with appropriate file naming.
Error messages for empty data or failed exports are displayed.
Unit tests cover table rendering, sorting, pagination, search, and export (all formats).
UI/UX is tested for responsiveness, accessibility, and export button clarity.
Feature is deployed and verified in production.
