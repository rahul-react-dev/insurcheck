Manage Invoices and Payments
Title: View, Pay Invoices, and Download Receipts
Story Description: As an admin user, I want to view and pay my invoices and download receipts in the Admin Panel so that I can manage my billing and maintain records of payments.
Acceptance Criteria:
Given I am logged into the Admin Panel, I can access an "Invoices" section displaying a table with columns: Invoice ID, Invoice Date, Due Date, Amount, Status (Paid, Unpaid, Overdue), Action (View, Pay, Download Receipt).
I can sort the table by Invoice ID, Invoice Date, Due Date, or Amount.
I can paginate the table with options for 10, 25, or 50 entries per page.
I can search by Invoice ID or Status.
I can export the table data in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats via an "Export" dropdown or buttons, with files named appropriately (e.g., "Invoices_{Timestamp}.pdf/csv/xlsx").
Clicking "View" in the Action column opens a detailed invoice page showing: Invoice ID, Invoice Date, Due Date, Amount, Status, Billing Details (e.g., Admin Name, Company Name, Billing Address), and Itemized Charges.
Clicking "Pay" for an Unpaid or Overdue invoice redirects to a payment interface supporting a default payment method (e.g., credit card or bank transfer).
Clicking "Download Receipt" for a Paid invoice downloads a PDF receipt named "Receipt_{Invoice_ID}.pdf" with Invoice ID, Payment Date, Amount, Payment Method, and Billing Details.
Payment actions (successful payments) are logged in the audit logs with Invoice ID, Timestamp, Action Type, and Status.
Validations with Success/Error Messages:
Table Data:
Success: Table loads with correct invoice data.
Error: If no data, display: "No invoices available."
Search:
Success: Results filter based on Invoice ID or Status input.
Error: If no results, display: "No results found."
Export:
Success: File downloads in selected format (PDF, CSV, Excel).
Error: "Failed to export [format]. Please try again."
Payment Process:
Success: "Payment successful. Receipt available for download."
Error: "Payment failed. Please try again."
Download Receipt:
Success: PDF receipt downloads with correct details.
Error: "Failed to download receipt. Please try again."
Expected Outcome:
The admin views and searches invoices, exports the invoice table in PDF, CSV, or Excel, pays unpaid/overdue invoices using a default payment method, and downloads receipts for paid invoices.
All actions are logged, and errors are communicated clearly.
