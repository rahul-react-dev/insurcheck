3.1 Audit Logs and Version History Table
Title: View and Export Audit Logs and Version History
Story Description: As a logged-in user, I want to view a table of audit logs and document version history and export it in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats so that I can track my past activities and document versions and save or share the data.
Acceptance Criteria:
Given I am on the dashboard, I see a table with columns: Log ID, Document Name, Version, Action Performed, Timestamp, User Email, Action (View, Email).
I can sort the table by Log ID, Timestamp, or Document Name.
I can paginate the table with options for 10, 25, or 50 entries per page.
I can search by Document Name or User Email.
I can export the table data in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats via an "Export" dropdown or buttons.
Exported files are named appropriately (e.g., "Audit_Logs_{Timestamp}.pdf/csv/xlsx").
Validations with Success/Error Messages:
Table Data:
Success: Table loads with correct data.
Error: If no data, display: "No audit logs available."
Search:
Success: Results filter based on input.
Error: If no results, display: "No results found."
Export:
Success: File downloads in selected format (PDF, CSV, Excel).
Error: "Failed to export [format]. Please try again."
Expected Outcome:
The user views, sorts, searches, and exports audit logs and version history in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats.
If no data is available or an export fails, clear error messages are displayed.
Definition of Done:
Table with specified columns is implemented on the dashboard.
Sorting, pagination (10, 25, 50 entries), and search by Document Name/User Email are functional.
Export functionality for PDF, CSV, and Excel is implemented with appropriate file naming.
Error messages for empty data or failed exports are displayed.
Unit tests cover table rendering, sorting, pagination, search, and export (all formats).
UI/UX is tested for responsiveness, accessibility, and export button clarity.
Features are deployed and verified in production.
