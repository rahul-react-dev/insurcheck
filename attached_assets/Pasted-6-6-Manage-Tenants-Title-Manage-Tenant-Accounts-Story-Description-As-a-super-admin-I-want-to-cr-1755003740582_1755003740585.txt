6.6 Manage Tenants
Title: Manage Tenant Accounts
Story Description: As a super admin, I want to create, edit, suspend, or delete tenant accounts so that I can oversee all organizations using the SaaS platform.
Acceptance Criteria:
Given I am on the Super Admin Dashboard, I see a table of tenants with columns: Tenant ID, Tenant Name, Primary Contact Email, Status (Active/Suspended/Deleted), Created Date, Subscription Plan, Actions (Edit, Suspend, Delete).
I can create a new tenant with fields: Tenant Name, Primary Contact Email, Subscription Plan.
I can edit tenant details (Tenant Name, Contact Email, Subscription Plan).
I can suspend or reactivate tenant accounts, restricting access for all users in the tenant.
I can delete tenant accounts, removing all associated data (users, documents, logs).
All actions are logged in the super admin audit logs.
Validations with Success/Error Messages:
Table Data:
Success: Table loads with correct tenant data.
Error: "No tenants found."
Create/Edit Tenant:
Success: "Tenant [created/updated] successfully."
Error: "Invalid tenant details. Please check inputs."
Suspend/Reactivate:
Success: "Tenant [suspended/reactivated] successfully."
Error: "Failed to update tenant status. Please try again."
Delete Tenant:
Success: "Tenant deleted successfully."
Error: "Failed to delete tenant. Please try again."
Expected Outcome:
The super admin can manage tenant accounts, with actions logged.
Definition of Done:
Tenant management table with specified columns is implemented.
Create, edit, suspend, and delete functionalities are functional.
Super admin audit log entries are created for all actions.
Error handling for failed actions is implemented.
Unit tests cover tenant management logic.
UI/UX is tested for responsiveness.
Feature is deployed and verified in production.
Add the ability to have a Status (active, locked, unverified, deactivated) for tenants. Admins can view users and delete/deactivate, but there's no mention of filtering by user status (active/inactive/pending verification).
Usage dashboards (monthly docs uploaded, compliance trends) Helps admins track team productivity or vendor performance
