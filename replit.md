# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture
The project employs a monorepo structure, separating `client-admin` (React frontend for Super and Tenant Admins), `client-user` (React frontend for Tenant Users), `server` (Express.js backend), and `shared` (common schemas).

## Frontend Architecture
All React frontends utilize Vite for building, Tailwind CSS with a custom blue gradient design system for styling, Redux Toolkit with Redux-Saga for state management, React Router for navigation, and Axios for HTTP requests. UI components are built using `shadcn/ui` based on Radix UI, ensuring design consistency.

## Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Express.js and TypeScript. It uses Drizzle ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database, implementing multi-tenancy via `tenant_id` fields. Authentication is JWT-based with role-based access control. API endpoints are RESTful, secured with middleware for CORS, helmet, and rate limiting, and include robust error handling.

## Database Design
A PostgreSQL database is used, managed by Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. The design supports multi-tenancy and a role-based user system.

## Security & Authentication
Security features include JWT tokens for stateless authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, `express-validator` for input sanitization, and role-based access control. CORS is configured to restrict access to allowed origins.
