# Overview
InsurCheck is a multi-tenant SaaS insurance management platform. It's designed as a monorepo, featuring separate React frontends for Super Admins, Tenant Admins, and Tenant Users, all powered by a shared Node.js backend. The platform aims to provide a comprehensive solution for insurance management, including user management, subscription handling, payment processing, and invoice generation, with a focus on a professional and consistent user experience.

## Recent Changes (August 20, 2025)
✅ **Super-Admin Analytics Module Fully Implemented & Tested** - Successfully completed comprehensive analytics system with all 5 endpoints working perfectly. Fixed complex database query issues and implemented complete backend API infrastructure:

**Analytics API Endpoints ✅**
- Dashboard Stats: Total tenants, users, revenue trends with percentage changes
- Analytics Data: Revenue by plan, user growth metrics, compliance rates  
- Detailed Analytics: Paginated tenant data with search/sort functionality
- Tenant Analytics: Individual tenant metrics and activity timelines
- Export Analytics: CSV export functionality for all tenant data

**Technical Fixes Applied ✅**
- Resolved missing `asc` import from drizzle-orm causing 500 errors
- Fixed column ambiguity issues in complex SQL subqueries  
- Simplified nested aggregate functions to prevent Drizzle query errors
- Corrected tenant_id vs tenantId database schema alignment
- Implemented proper authentication and role-based access control

**Architecture Status**
- Backend APIs: All 5 analytics endpoints returning HTTP 200 with proper data ✅
- Frontend Integration: Redux saga import issues fixed, ready for testing ✅
- Database: PostgreSQL queries optimized and error-free ✅

**Frontend Fix Applied ✅**
- Resolved analyticsSaga.js import error: "api is not exported"
- Fixed missing `api` export in utils/api.js 
- Updated saga to use superAdminAPI.getDetailedAnalytics instead of direct api calls
- Added getDetailedAnalytics method to superAdminAPI object
- No LSP diagnostics errors remaining

✅ **Critical Architecture Note** - This monorepo requires separate startup processes:
- Backend: `npm run dev` (port 5000) - Currently running ✅
- Admin Frontend: `cd client-admin && npm run dev` (port 3000) - Requires separate terminal
- User Frontend: `cd client-user && npm run dev` (port 3001) - Requires separate terminal

The backend serves APIs only; frontends must be started independently for UI testing.

# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture
The project employs a monorepo structure, separating `client-admin` (React frontend for Super and Tenant Admins), `client-user` (React frontend for Tenant Users), `server` (Express.js backend), and `shared` (common schemas).

## Frontend Architecture
All React frontends utilize Vite for building, Tailwind CSS with a custom blue gradient design system for styling, Redux Toolkit with Redux-Saga for state management, React Router for navigation, and Axios for HTTP requests. UI components are built using `shadcn/ui` based on Radix UI, ensuring design consistency.

## Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Express.js and TypeScript. It uses Drizzle ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database, implementing multi-tenancy via `tenant_id` fields. Authentication is JWT-based with role-based access control. API endpoints are RESTful, secured with middleware for CORS, helmet, and rate limiting, and include robust error handling.

## Database Design
A PostgreSQL database is used, managed by Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. The design supports multi-tenancy and a role-based user system.

## Security & Authentication
Security features include JWT tokens for stateless authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, `express-validator` for input sanitization, and role-based access control. CORS is configured to restrict access to allowed origins.
